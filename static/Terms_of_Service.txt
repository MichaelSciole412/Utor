Terms of Service

Safety Policy
If you experience harassment in any form please contact our email: utor.service@gmail.com with your username and a description of the issue.

We will review the issue and take appropriate actions (see Violating Utor’s Terms of Service).

Honesty Policy
Users are expected to be forthright and honest about what they are capable of tutoring. Users who are reported as not knowing any relevant subject matter in regards to what they claim to be able to tutor will be reviewed by Utor’s team. If tutors on the site are in fact incapable of tutoring they will be found in violation of our terms of service (see Violating Utor’s Terms of Service).

Violating Utor’s Terms of Service
If we receive a complaint about a user account and determine that our policy has been violated, the user in question will be removed from our site immediately. In the event that another user’s safety was threatened or a crime was committed we will turn over any relevant evidence to authorities in an effort to protect our users.
